# Photo gallery webpage

The result of this project can be accessed here https://mrtbsc.github.io/Projects/Web-Gallery/.
Its ojective was to practice **HTML and CSS** creating a **responsive** gallery webpage for an imaginary photography brand.

## Inspiration
The idea to do a Photo gallery and its design came from the very helpful page https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/. Since the Photo gallery project there was used more to determine what to create rather than how to code it, there might be several difference in the code between the 2 projects.
 
## Status
It is almost finished, yet the following upgrades are to be added:
- Fix photo jumps on loading 
- Fix zooming out for desktop view
- Improve design for phone view
- Decrease image loading time
