# Form webpage
The result of this project can be accessed here https://mrtbsc.github.io/Projects/HTML%20CSS-Form/ .Its ojective was to practice HTML and CSS forms creating a survey to choose the menu for an imaginary lunch.

## Inspiration
The idea came from the very helpful page https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/ and a rather gluttonous mood.

## Status
It is finished, but some improvements might be added in the future.

## Possible future improvements
Images could be clickable to select its associated check-box, and have a hover effect.
Improve responsiveness.
A back-end part could be built to save the results (and also enable the users to change them if they had a change of mind).
